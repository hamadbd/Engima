In this example, we start by defining a function download_and_convert_image that can download an image from a URL and convert it to a NumPy array. This function will be used later to read live data.

Next, we load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset as before, and define the neural network architecture and compilation as well.

Then, we define a new function predict_from_live_data that continuously reads live data from the URL https://picsum.photos/200 and makes predictions using the trained model. In this case, we are simply using a random image generator provided by picsum.photos, but you can substitute this with any other data source.

Finally, we train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset as before, and call the predict_from_live_data function to start making predictions from live data.

This example demonstrates how Enigma AI can be used to make predictions in real-time using live data from free open sources.
